== Q013. If the pre-order items in the PO arrive early. Can the pre-ordered items be released to a specific warehouse before the promise date?

Yes, if the pre-ordered items are available before the promise date then they can be manually released to a particular warehouse using the Preorder Management application.

Note: While calling the releaseOrderItem API, If the toFacilityId is not NA and changeReasonEnumId is BROKERED then item is released to the warehouse/facility.
