== Q016. If less than expected quantity arrives in the PO. How to cancel the pre-ordered items that cannot be fulfilled?

The retailer can navigate to the product details screen of the Preorder Management app and enter the number of pre-order items that need to be cancelled. Entered number of pre-ordered items will be cancelled.

The pre-ordered items will be cancelled based on the last-in-first-out basis i.e. the newest pre-order for the item will be cancelled first followed by the newer pre-orders

Retailers can also import CSV in OMS to cancel the pre-orders.
