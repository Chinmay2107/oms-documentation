## Introduction

Integrations with Order Management Systems (OMS) play a pivotal role in enhancing operational efficiency and streamlining business 
processes. In the dynamic landscape of modern commerce, where businesses rely on diverse tools and platforms for various functions, 
integrations serve as the bridge that connects these disparate systems. An integration refers to the seamless connection and data exchange
between an OMS and other critical business application systems, such as e-commerce platforms, inventory management, Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP), Point Of Sale (POS) and many more.

Integrations empower businesses to automate workflows, streamline order management processes, and enhance overall operational agility. 
In essence, these integrations act as the backbone of a well-orchestrated and efficient business infrastructure, driving growth and 
customer satisfaction.
