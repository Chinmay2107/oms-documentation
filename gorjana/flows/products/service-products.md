# Service Products

This document contains all the special conditions when and how service products will be added to orders.

## First time customers
First time customers are provided with a special introduction flyer. This product is only fulfilled from the warehouse and included with an order the first time a customer shops with Gorjana.

## Gift wrapping
Customers can select particular items in their cart to be gift wrapped. This choice is saved in Shopify using line item properties of that order item. Line item properites are saved in HotWax as order item attributes which can then be used to process this automation.

## Keepsake box
A special Keepsake box is included with the purchase of special products of higher value. This is not part of the order in Shopify and will instead need to be added to the order after it is created in HotWax. The products that trigger this automation are not yet shared.
