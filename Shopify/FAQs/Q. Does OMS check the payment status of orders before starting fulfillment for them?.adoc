== Q. Does OMS check the payment status of orders before starting fulfillment for them?

Yes, OMS checks the payment status of orders before starting fulfillment for them. 

Order fulfillment only starts in OMS if it has a Riskified approved tag in Shopify. 

If an order does not have a Riskified approved tag in Shopify then the order is imported in created status and its fulfillment does not start. 

The OMS regularly checks for Riskified approved tag for the order when the service *_checkRiskifiedTagAndApproveOrders_* runs. 

Once the order has a Riskified approved tag in the Shopify then it is approved in OMS and its fulfillment can start.
