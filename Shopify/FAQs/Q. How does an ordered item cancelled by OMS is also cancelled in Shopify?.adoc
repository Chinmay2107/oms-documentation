== Q. How does an ordered item cancelled by OMS is also cancelled in Shopify?

If an ordered item is cancelled in OMS then a service is triggered that cancels the ordered item in Shopify as well. 

If a retailer does not want to allow OMS to cancel ordered items in Shopify then this service can be disabled
